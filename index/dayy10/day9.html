        <h1 id="hello">holi</h1>
        <p>Holi (Hindi pronunciation: ['hoːli:]) is a popular and significant Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love, and Spring.[1][10][11][12] It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna.[13][14] Additionally, the day signifies the triumph of good over evil,[15][16] as it commemorates the victory of Vishnu as Narasimha over Hiranyakashipu.[17][18] Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent of India and Nepal, but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian diaspora</p>

        <h1 id="hmm">sankranti</h1>
        <p>Sankranti (Sanskrit: सङ्क्रान्ति, romanized: Saṁkrānti) refers to the transmigration of the sun from one zodiac to another in Indian astronomy. In Saurmana varsha (Hindu Solar year), there are twelve Sankrantis corresponding with twelve months of a year.[1] The Sankrantis can be broadly classified into four main categories: Ayan (Solstice), Vishuva (Equinox), Vishnupadi and Shadshitimukhi sankrantis.[1]</p>

        <h1 id="hi">christmas</h1>
        <p>Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.[2][3][4] A feast central to the liturgical year in Christianity, it follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night.[</p>

        <p>Eid al-Adha (Arabic: عيد الأضحى, romanized: ʿĪd al-ʾAḍḥā, EED əl AD-hə; IPA: [ˈʕiːd alˈʔadˤħaː]), commonly translated as the Feast of Sacrifice and also known as Yawm an-Nahr (Arabic: يوم النحر, romanized: Yawm al-Naḥr), is the second of the two main Islamic holidays alongside Eid al-Fitr. In the Islamic calendar, Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of the twelfth and final month of Dhu al-Hijja, and celebrations and observances are generally carried forward to the three following days, known as the Tashreeq days.</p>
